				h1 Wireless Internet Policy
				hr
				p The Student Technology Fee Committee recognizes the necessity of robust, reliable, and widely available wifi on campus. However, it is our opinion the fee should not be used in its continued maintenance or expansion.
				p When the STFC first began funding wifi expansions on campus, the technology was new and innovative. The intent was to bring prestige to the university and create increased bandwidth options for students on campus. By this criteria, we believe the project has been a success and the original funding has been well justified. However, like many other successful technologies, wifi has become so ubiquitous that it is hardly noticed as long as it continues to function. It is now similar to other resources such as electricity, plumbing, and heating: effectively, a utility.  Being a utility and therefore part of the basic infrastructure of the university,  the Student Technology Fee will not pay for its continued use and maintenance, just as we do not pay for other infrastructure. 
			#consumables.setup-content
				h1 Consumables Policy
				hr
				h3 Purpose &amp; Overview
				p Each year the Student Technology Fee Committee (STFC) appropriates funding for technology that requires consumables goods. This includes toner, filaments for 3D printers, non-reusable batteries, etc. This document mandates the proper use of the Student Technology Fee in purchasing consumables.
				
				h3 Policy Language
				ol(type="1") 
					li Definitions
						ol(type="a")
							li Consumables: a commodity that is intended to be used up relatively quickly.
							li Groups: The entity responsible for maintaining the STF funded project or equipment.
					li Charging For Consumables
						ol(type="a")
							li Groups may charge students for consumables up to the price of the consumable.
							li The group must disclose the intention to levy this fee in the proposal.
							li A fee can be levied after the proposal is approved only after a majority vote in favor of the fee by the committee. 
							ul(style="list-style-type:square")
								li The funds may only be used to purchase new consumables for student use on the project from which the fee was collected
					li Charging For Access
						ol(type="a")
							li Groups may not charge students for access.
							li Departments may charge non-students for consumables or access.
				h3 Discussion
				p The committee remains committed to reducing any financial barriers that impede student access to technology. This policy is not an endorsement of charging for consumables but rather acknowledgment that there may be situations where a group lacks the financial resources to continue providing the requisite consumables for students. We believe the continued success and availability of these projects hinge upon the departmentâ€™s ability to collect a minimal fee that offsets the price of the consumable. The committee seeks to mitigate potential negative effects by restricting this fee to its narrowest possible form. 

			#compliance.setup-content
				h1 Compliance Policy
				hr
				h3 Purpose & Overview
				p Our committee has always been by and for students. We collect money from fees with the mandate to provide technology for students at the University of Washington. In doing so we make difficult decisions on where to provide funding. It is our duty to choose carefully and make our best effort to oversee the execution of funded proposals is in the best interest of the student body. In order to do so, the fee requires funded proposals comply with the oversight of the Student Technology Fee Committee as defined in this and all other current official committee documents.
				h3 Policy Language

					li Oversight Period
						ol(type="a")
							li Items under $10,000 will have a default oversight period of three years.
					li Use of Funds
						ol(type="a")
							li Funds may only be spent on those items listed in the proposal at the time of approval.
							li Any alternative item purchased must be approved by a supplemental; this includes purchasing equivalent equipment or a different model at the same or lower price.
					li Reporting Requirements
						ol(type="a")
							li All funded projects are required to submit quarterly reports to the committee during the first year after receiving funding.
							li For the years following, the STFC requires annual reports for the duration of the oversight period
							li The committee may require more frequent reporting - quarterly or monthly
					li Field Visits
						ol(type="a")
							li The Committee will visit grant sites to learn about the demand for particular technology, ensure compliance with Committee rules, and spread awareness of the STFC.
							ol(type="i")
								li Visits will be initiated by contacting the project lead on the original proposal.
								li These visits will also be used to understand more intricate details of proposals.
					li Maintenance of Equipment
						ol(type="a")
							li Departments must provide the necessary support for maintaining equipment in good working condition.
							li The department must facilitate the maximum student use of equipment.
							li A department no longer able to provide support must notify the committee so steps can be taken to ensure proper maintenance.
							ol(type="i")
								li Should this occur during the oversight period, it will be taken into account when considering future funding.
							li A control system must be in place to prevent theft, loss, and damage.
							li Any theft, loss, or damage, must be reported to the committee in a timely manner.
					li Insurance
						ol(type="a")
							li Groups must maintain insurance on STF equipment when required by the committee.
							li The committee, via the program coordinator, must be notified of any insurance replacements within a timely manner.
					li Accessibility and Availability
						ol(type="a")
							li All items funded by the STF must be used primarily by students for the duration it is under STFC oversight.

							li Student use should be promoted, including taking reasonable steps to advertise when appropriate.
					li Compliance Actions
						p The actions discussed below are not intended to be comprehensive lists, rather a measure of the severity of each action. Should a new action (one not discussed below) be decided, we hope that it is done in a process matching its severity.
							ol(type="a")
								li At any time and without vote, the committee can take the following mild actions:
								ol(type="i")
									li The committee maintains records on the success and failures of a project and will this as a metric for judging future proposals.

									li Require consistent and constant updates.
								li The following actions are extreme. These possible actions can only be taken after an impartial tribunal of students, composed of two members from each the ASUW and GPSS Judiciary committees and a single elected member from the STFC, has been convened to adjudicate the consequence of non-compliance.The committee and the project representatives will be given opportunity to speak at these hearings, which will occur only after a the project has been in a probationary period of no less than one month.
								ol(type="i")
									li A ban on new proposals from offending parties.
									li Seizing of any and all equipment funded by the STF to be redistributed elsewhere on campus, or otherwise disposed of (e.g. sold or leased to inside or outside organizations).
									li Other sanctions or actions as determined by the adjudicating committee.
			#accessibility.setup-content
				h1 Accessibility Policy
				hr
				h3 Purpose & Overview
				p Given that the Student Technology Fee (STF) is collected from nearly every student enrolled at the University of Washington, the Student Technology Fee Committee (STFC) finds that accessibility to equipment funded with STF funds is an important criterion by which STF proposals should be evaluated.
				p While the Committee recognizes that there are many legitimate reasons for limiting access to resources, the Committee favors more accessible technology for students.
				p The Committee also recognizes that students with disabilities often encounter barriers when using technology resources. The Committee will give special consideration to proposals including adaptive technologies that provide disabled users access.
